        <p>I am strong, my body is strong.</p>
<p>You are weak, and your body is weak.</p>
<p>No, I feel my body is strong.</p>
<p>But your body feels weak.</p>
<p>In relation to my universe I am weak, but in relation to everybody&hellip;</p>
<p>Everybody is weak, you are one of everybody.</p>
<p>In relation to everybody I am the same strength, but to some I can lift many heavy things.</p>
<p>It is not heavy things that you must lift to show your strength. I ask you to lift the blade in front of the samurai, would you say to them that you find it heavy, or light? Next you must lift the pen in self defence from the lawyer. Will your words obey the abstract and strike transparent to your success, or fall flat against the master? Possibly you are put in a position of great power. Will you lead with the honed vision of an economist, or blunder passionately into the unknown? What about lifting your family up to new heights - do you have the strength to be provider and protector, confidant and coach? It is likely that in rapid succesion you will stumble in front of your enemies, hand over your rights and be a disgrace to your country, company and family. This is the fate of someone who feels that they are strong compared to others.</p>
<p>I will experience this for myself, and therefore I can understand the lesson.</p>
<p>In the first instance you are dead, or disabled. In the second you have lost your freedom and your identity. In the third you abused and squandered your position, likely at the expense of human life. In the last all that was precious to you has abandoned you. Do you need to experience so as to formally decide the outcome of an unknown? Would not practice in the disciplines of the state, strategy and law, decrease the unknowns in conflicts of this kind?</p>
<p>In my experience I will create my own solutions, which others can use for their practice.</p>
<p>If there was half a question, you would be right and this would be a full answer. Is a solution any different when the outcome is the same? When you apply evidence based analysis to a problem, you can already match problems to solutions, and solutions to results. Where can you find the answer? Can you deconstruct into individual pieces the thing you desire to achieve? The cycle of experiments is forever spinning in place and growing in diameter, it is easy to pay attention to the mechanism, but you will have difficulty in fixing it if handled carelessly. When you do arrive somewhere novel, you will have self awareness.</p>
