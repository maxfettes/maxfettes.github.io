      <description>It was all a dream Dreams are a cosmic telepathy into the minds of your multiversal selves. This is self-evident when you consider the infinite universes theory.
Once upon a time in Babylon. Once upon a time in Proxima Centauri. Once upon this time that you exist, and you know to be true. In each of these three versions, an equivalent technological apex has been achieved. The debate on flying cars is in.</description>

      <description>this time in ten years, my most visionary and hardworking friends will be rich. not cushy graduate positions and tennis club rich, but coffers and assets, well written trust funds and property in the scottish isles rich. veins of green, pristine walls and economic minimalism. where once they thought of altruism as a sacrifice to career, now bolsters their portfolio. who were creatives; optimistic and profound; heads of class and scholastic society, will be shareholders in the GenZ^2 creatives, again bolstering their portfolio with the vitality of the new dreamers.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;A picnic in a park.&amp;rsquo; The cruelty you need to place upon the PM in proposing that this is a part of a political blueprint is so great that I cannot take you seriously anymore. From this point onwards I am a non-believer. It was a relatively short stretch when the concensus attracted delusions of an orchestrated nightmare. A concesus, that is, or rather voices of the charged and opinionated minorty.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Be humble, Earthlings.&amp;rsquo; I know about filters already, thank you. I did not need to read this again that yes we are either doomed and leaving behind an astro-archaeolgist&amp;rsquo;s wet dream, or we are not doomed and a statistical anomaly. I did not need this heavy emotional response to the mistakes of the last century (to say the least), and the wrench of gut from Mr. Obvious that our multiverse cousins who sat down and spent some $18^12 on interstellar exploration instead of a world war are in a better place right now.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Be humble, Earthlings.&amp;rsquo; I am strong, my body is strong.
You are weak, and your body is weak.
No, I feel my body is strong.
But your body feels weak.
In relation to my universe I am weak, but in relation to everybody&amp;hellip;
Everybody is weak, you are one of everybody.
In relation to everybody I am the same strength, but to some I can lift many heavy things.
It is not heavy things that you must lift to show your strength.</description>

      <description>a colourful sort &amp;lsquo;Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s because it is very enjoyable.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;But perhaps you&amp;rsquo;d say that it isn&amp;rsquo;t compatible with our community&amp;rsquo;s political system,&amp;rsquo; I went on, &amp;lsquo;because each of our people has a single job to do, and therefore none of them is two-sided or many-sided.&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right: it&amp;rsquo;s incompatible.&amp;rsquo; - Republic: &amp;lsquo;Primary Education for the Guardians.&amp;rsquo;

      <description>As we cross over the anniversary of COVID (for me born sometime during the Táº¿t 2020 holidays, aka lunar new year), I want to start sharing my ideas for the new age. This blog will act as an inquiry into those ideas, and a space for them to grow.
If you thought you could skip the years between idealogical discovery and social implementation, you have already contributed to the downfall of humankind.</description>
