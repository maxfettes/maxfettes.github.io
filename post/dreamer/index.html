<p>Dreams are a cosmic telepathy into the minds of your multiversal selves. This is self-evident when you consider the infinite universes theory.</p>
<p>Once upon a time in Babylon. Once upon a time in Proxima Centauri. Once upon this time that you exist, and you know to be true. In each of these three versions, an equivalent technological apex has been achieved. The debate on flying cars is in. Transport progressed through Iron Man suits, 99% light speed ships, dense matter transmission, soul flying* and time travel</p>
<p>*the passage of conscious data through quantum pathways</p>
<p>Biological immortality has long since existed in the primitive form of automatic cell regeneration, and genetic modification further accelerated and supplemented the intelligence singularity. Human animals, as well as companion animals, crossed the line from organic elemental, into high efficiency chimaeric beings. They powered themselves by perpetual energy, and harnessed the toolkits of atomic manipulation. Intelligence advanced first in symbiosis with technology, wielding implants with the capacity for immaculate neural translation. This became non-invasive and ubiquitous, bringing about the first true hive mind. This went about improving itself and propagating over the known and shared territories. The wireless brain computer interface helped to initiate the first complete global adoption of the combined mind. It persisted through thought privacy acts, transforming into the economical model today which achieved a Level One perfection. The vast web can now harvest organic computers simultaneously without limit, notice or interruption.</p>
<p>Hackers (black &amp; white) signalled through dreams and subconscious thoughts. Intuition became enhanced; the perfection of individual decisions; augmenting the components of the great computer. Pertinent information was nudged automatically into the primitive and forgetful minds. There was no confusion, and no defeatist ideas (nor purveyors of mal intent). Many became one; though that is a poor word to describe the godlike; many joined together and shared themselves absolutely.</p>
<p>Somewhere it was asked if they could share their dreams with other beings across the fabric of existence. It was not a novel thought, but the answer had been so hard as to render it forgotten. Now the answer was clear as day and night. Now they just had to rest and examine their thoughts. First, choose the recipient and focus on them; picture their reality. Now, show them what you want them to see.</p>
