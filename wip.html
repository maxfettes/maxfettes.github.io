        seen a ghost<br />
before knowing it was i<br />

and i<br />

*reminisces*<br />

sally, privee<br />

a fleshed out margin<br />

like a chance in hell.<br />

it's true we had embellished,<br />

hacked our way to stability<br />

in hope that they'd believe we tried.<br />

in all honesty,<br />

my marriage was a lie.<br />

in fact, marriage is a lie<br />

that makes me tingle,<br />

jonsing for a cut from pride.<br />

*simultaneous rage/effervescence*<br />

rally! herald! fly!<br />

foolish ballard!<br />

my bloody guy!<br />

sonovamotherfucker,<br />

tic tocker,<br />

joker and sly old dog.<br />

you crocodile log,<br />

groggy little sprite and castle,<br />

flog me, whip me,<br />

rainbow pastel,<br />

shape shifter,<br />

fister and soft lover.<br />

i knew you were my honest brother!<br />

don't you dare flutter eyes at me!<br />

you know i will concede to you.<br />

black and blue my conscience runs,<br />

but no i don't run back to that,<br />

i am too skinny for fat head liars.<br />

first you grab the money,<br />

then fix me with the pliers.<br />

<p><cite>Jezebel </cite><del>was</del> had been a bit more sketch than the rest of us had seen before. Parry and I and I had snorted that from through a tiny peephole still could judge her like you wouldn't have believed just like<i> fifteen years ago.</i> Strange that even though I was fat that it's not hard minding back and being fun. She is younger too though not that that's anybodies fault but her conception and someone said that she'd been making stories up.<abbr title="because">Bc</abbr> who these days is not encultured for a little boose except those truly demon filled who had and had and had too much? Blasted but it always was a laugh for us until the disco died and if he'd had a proper family then I would have learned about it but frankly wasn't raising any eyebrows or even blinking when I heard of him and he was poisoning some kids he'd made born straight in to a foster home as orphans from a dead man (he had become a man) and their mother who of course was just another sally too and and made quite sure the cheques came in and truly no-one was complaining. Jezabel meanwhile on the otherside of the world was looking frightening herself only around twelve or thirteen at the time and not only not dreaming but being beat, slapped by her future enemies who she truly thought may be her friends. So a young and naive one is the only type of cat who can fall down and not just get back up but start a different life. Meanwhile again and six years has passed since one of the most gorgeous minds lay waste to himself and lay deceased beside his wife, not opening a book since the bountied suffering childhood that was truly one degree away from just right, truly a murder didn't take place until we'd all left school or yet were leaving</p>
